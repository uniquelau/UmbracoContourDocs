#Creating a form
##Navigate to the Contour section
Managing forms happens in the Contour section of the Umbraco backoffice so first navigate to this section by selecting it (you'll need to have Contour installed and have access to this section in order to see it).

##Right click the forms tree
Next similar to most create actions in the Umbraco backoffice you'll have to right click the forms tree/folder and select create

##Name the form
After selecting create you should see the following dialog

Where you'll need to supply a name for the form and have the option to start from a template (the template will already have some fields definied so you don't start from a completely empty form).

Hitting create will obviously create your new form.

##Design the form

The next screen you should see after hitting the create button is the form designer

There is already a page and a fieldset available the rest of the form has to be added using the UI(unless you started from a template then you alreayd get some fields).
