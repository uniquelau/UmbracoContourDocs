#Upgrading
Running an older version of Contour and want to upgrade, just follow these steps

##Get the latest version
The latest stable version of Contour can always be found on the [project page](http://our.umbraco.org/projects/umbraco-pro/contour), to perform an upgrade you'll need to download the UmbracoContour_X.X.X_update.zip file (where X.X.X is the version number). An overview of what has changed can be found [here](http://nightly.umbraco.org/Umbraco%20Contour/changes.txt).

##Extract the archive 
The downloaded archive contains all the files needed to perform an update, it isn't a package but a zip file with the new files. These new files need to be xcopied over the existing ones...

##Clear browser cache
To make sure you are running the latest version of the javascript files make sure to clear your browser chache after performing an upgrade
